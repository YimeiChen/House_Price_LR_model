# House_Price_LR_model
In this regression case study, we used R and linear regression to analyze the value of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. 
A major component of online companies like Redfin (https://www.redfin.com) and Zillow (https://www.zillow.com) is their ability to develop estimates for the cost of a house currently on the market. In this study, we will act like an employee at one of these companies. 
In particular, we will use regression analysis to complete two major tasks:
- Explore the features of houses in in Ames, Iowa and build an explanatory regression model that describes which aspects of a home most strongly a↵ects its value.
- Build a predictive model that most closely forecasts the value at which the house will be sold.


1 Description of Data
The dataset we will be analyzing in this study is saved in the housing.txt file, and a description of each variable in the data set is provided in the Data Description.txt file on the github site.
The data contains 1460 observations with 79 variables, including a house ID and the sale price of each house.

2 Part I: Explanatory Modeling

Task 1: Our first task is to determine what features of a house are most relevent in determining its expected sale price. 
Build an appropriate regression model to answer this question, and provide any exploratory plots and analyses that may be useful
in our discussion. We will discuss in detail our findings based on the fit of the regression model and model choices. 
our final model.

Task 2: We assume a customer, Morty, comes to us wondering if we can help him figure out the sell price of his house. 
The information on his house is available in the Morty.txt file. He has already been told from another firm 
(as shown in the data), that his house will sell for $143,000. Based on the features of his house, we provide Morty a maximum value of what we think 
he could possibly sell his house for as is. 

3 Part II: Predictive Modeling
We will finally develop the “best” regression model for predicting the sale price of a 
house for new homes on the market.
