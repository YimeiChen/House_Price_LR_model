# House Price Prediction - Linear Regression

Team Members:

Chris Dong, Yimei Chen, Qian Li, Jing Song

## Goal


In this regression case study, we used R and linear regression to analyze the value of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. 
A major component of online companies like Redfin (https://www.redfin.com) and Zillow (https://www.zillow.com) is their ability to develop estimates for the cost of a house currently on the market. In this study, we will act like an employee at one of these companies. 


In particular, we will use regression analysis to complete two major tasks:


- Explore the features of houses in in Ames, Iowa and build an explanatory regression model that describes which aspects of a home most strongly aâ†µects its value.


- Build a predictive model that most closely forecasts the value at which the house will be sold.


## Description of Data


The dataset we will be analyzing in this study is saved in the housing.txt file, and a description of each variable in the data set is provided in the Data Description.txt file on the github site.


The data contains 1460 observations with 79 variables, including a house ID and the sale price of each house.


## Report


The report is a complete demonstration of the discussion and summary of the prediction as well as evaluation.
